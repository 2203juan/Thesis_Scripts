# Thesis Repository - Juan José Hoyos Urcué
This is the code repository for my underdegree Thesis.

![Project Logo](land.png)

Inside this repository there are two folders (dataset-1 and dataset-2)

**dataset-1**: contains the thesis code applied to the initial data set provided by CIDEIM, with which the research was almost completely developed.

**dataset-2**: contains the same code with minor modifications adapted to a new dataset provided by CIDEIM in the last months of my research. 


Within these directories, you will find same two folders : 1-without_data_augmentation and 2-with_data_augmentation

Inside these two folder you will find a  README.md file that explains the order and functionality of each jupyter notebook file.

To look for the best model GUI prediction , please build and run the docker image hosted in this repo:
https://github.com/2203juan/LeishPredict-web

add also the dataset shared with you into core_app folder

it exposes the web app into port 5000.
